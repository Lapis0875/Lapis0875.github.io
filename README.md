My published hexo blog repository. Hexo codes are stored in [here](https://github.com/Lapis0875/LapisBlog-Hexo).
My published blog website is [here](https://lapisblog.me).
I'm using hexo theme called `icarus`, which can be found on [here](https://github.com/ppoffice/hexo-theme-icarus). And my icarus theme has a `night` mode function, which can be found on [here](https://github.com/ppoffice/hexo-theme-icarus/issues/564). The night mode function is managed by forked branch of icarus theme, [`night`](https://github.com/imaegoo/hexo-theme-icarus/tree/night).
